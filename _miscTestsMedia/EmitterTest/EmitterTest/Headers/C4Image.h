/**This document describes the C4Image class. A C4Image object provides access for creating, showing, interacting and manipulating images. C4Image is a subclass of C4Control and so inherits its animation, gesture and notification abilities.
 
 C4Image also takes advantage of its underlying C4Layer to allow for filtering the content of an image. You can apply filters that affect only the image (e.g. hueAdjust, vibranceAdjust, etc.) or use another image as the background for a particular blend or composite filter (e.g. additionComposite:, overlayBlend:, etc).
 
 When working with blends and composite methods, it is recommended that the images you use are of the same size.
