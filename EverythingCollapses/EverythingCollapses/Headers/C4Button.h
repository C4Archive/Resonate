/**This document describes the C4Button class. An instance of the C4Button class implements a button on the touch screen. A button intercepts touch events and sends an action message to a target object when tapped. 
 
 The C4Button class implements a UIButton embedded in a C4Control view with bindings directly to the native object. That is, many of the methods in this class are simpy wrappers for triggering the same methods on the contained UIButton.
 
This class provides methods for setting the title, image, and other appearance properties of a button. By using these accessors, you can specify a different appearance for each button state.
