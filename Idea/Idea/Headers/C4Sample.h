/**This document describes C4Sample a simple class for loading and playing individual audio files.
 
 C4Sample encapsulates an instance of the AVAudioPlayer class, called an audio player, provides playback of audio data from a file or memory.
  
 Using an audio player you can:
 
 Play sounds of any duration
 Play sounds from files or memory buffers
 Loop sounds
 Play multiple sounds simultaneously, one sound per audio player, with precise synchronization
 Control relative playback level, stereo positioning, and playback rate for each sound you are playing
 Seek to a particular point in a sound file, which supports such application features as fast forward and rewind

 The C4Sample class lets you play sound in any audio format available in iOS. You implement a delegate to handle interruptions (such as an incoming phone call) and to update the user interface when a sound has finished playing. The delegate methods to use are described in AVAudioPlayerDelegate Protocol Reference.
