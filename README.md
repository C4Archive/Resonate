Resonate
========

These are the files, code, assets, etc. I used to produce the 10 mini-apps used in my talk at Resonate Festival on April 4, 2014.

To run you will need:

- Xcode 5
- iOS 7.1 sdk
- iPad Air (because it looks badass on retina)

The order of the presentation was:

- Intro
- NOSK
- EverythingCollapses
- Taccuino
- TypeIs
- Fields
- Shift
- Properties
- ArtMovieView
- Conclusion

Additional files:

- *_miscTestsMedia*: contains a bunch of files i was working on to hammer out the look / feel, etc.
- *_script*: was the text I followed throughout most of the talk
