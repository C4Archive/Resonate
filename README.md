Resonate
========

These are the files, code, assets, etc. I used to produce the 10 mini-apps used in my talk at Resonate Festival on April 4, 2014.

They can be run in Xcode, and have been designed for iPad Air.

The order of the presentation was:

Intro
NOSK
EverythingCollapses
Taccuino
TypeIs
Fields
Shift
Properties
ArtMovieView
Conclusion

Additional files:
_miscTestsMedia contains a bunch of files i was working on to hammer out the look / feel, etc.
_script was the text I followed throughout most of the talk
